### Mandatory tasks
* [0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing](./0-positive_or_negative.c) -
 a program that assigns a random number to the variable n and prints whether
 it is positive or negative.

* [1. The last digit](./1-last_digit.c) - a program that assigns a random number
 to the variable n and prints the last digit of n and whether it is greater than
 5, 0, or less than 6 and not 0.

* [2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what
 I call the alphabet game](./2-print_alphabet.c) - a program that prints the
 alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line

* [3. alphABET](./3-print_alphabets.c) -  a program that prints the alphabet in
 lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

* [4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off](./4-print_alphabt.c) -
 A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, except
 for the letters q and e.

* [5. Numbers](./5-print_numbers.c) -  a program that prints all single digit
 numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

* [6. Numberz](./6-print_numberz.c) - a program that prints all single digit
 numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line,
 without using char data types.

* [7. Smile in the mirror](./7-print_tebahpla.c) - a program that prints the
 lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

* [8. Hexadecimal](./8-print_base16.c) - a program that prints all the numbers
 of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

* [9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success](./9-print_comb.c) - 
 a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers,
 separated by commas and a space.

### Advanced tasks

* [10. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need](./100-print_comb3.c) - 
 a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits, where, 
 you print only the smallest combination of two digits and numbers should be
 printed in ascending order, with two digits.

* [11. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do...](./101-print_comb4.c) -
 a program that prints all possible combinations of three-digit numbers,
 separated by commas and a space, where the numbers are different and the first
 number is less than the second number, which is less than the third number.

* [12.  Software is eating the World](./102-print_comb5.c) - A program that prints
 all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers, separated by a space,
 where the numbers are different and the first number is less than the second number.
  
### Usage

To run any of the scripts or programs in this directory, compile them with the
following command (replacing [file] with the name of the file you wish to compile):

	gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic [file] -o [output_file]

To run the resulting executable, type:

	./[output_file]
