# C Low Level Programming

This repository contains materials and resources for learning and practicing
C programming. C is a low-level programming language that is widely used in
system programming, embedded systems and operating systems.

## Getting Started

To get started with C programming language, you will need a C compiler installed
on your machine. Some popular compilers for C are:

  	-GCC(GNU) Compiler Collection
  	-Clang
  	-Microsoft Visual Studio

Once you have a C compiler installed, you can use any text editor or Integrated
Development Environment (IDE) to write your C code.Some popular text editors
and IDEs for C programming are:

 	-Vim
 	-Emacs
 	-Sublime Text
 	-Visual Studio Code
 	-Eclipse
