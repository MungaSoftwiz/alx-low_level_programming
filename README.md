# Low Level Programming

-Welcome to my GitHub repository! This collection of projects is focused on C programming at the low level.
-If you're interested in low-level programming and enjoy the challenge of working with machine-level code, then you're in the right place.
-Here you will find a range of projects that demonstrate how to write code that interacts directly with hardware and
-performs complex operations using minimal system resources.Below is a list of all directories:

* [0x00. C - Hello, World](0x00-hello_world)

* [0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](0x01-variables_if_else_while)
